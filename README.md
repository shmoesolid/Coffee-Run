# Coffee Run
User Story:
    As a coffee drinker,
    I want to find nearby coffee shops,
    so that I am able to get my caffiene fix.

    WHEN I put in my location
    THEN nearby cafe's will pop up
    WHEN I click on a cafe
    THEN the directions will be displayed
    WHEN I look to find today's weather conditions
    THEN I can find it displayed on the site

Developers:
- Shane Koehler
- Robert Jarrell
- Jaylan Wienckowski

We plan on using the Bulma Framework for the project, the TrueWay Places and the Open Weather App for the two APIs.
